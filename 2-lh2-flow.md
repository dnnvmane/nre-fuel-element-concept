### **2. Coolant Flow (LH₂) Characteristics**

The fuel element is cooled by a continuous flow of liquid hydrogen (LH₂). The working principle involves the LH₂ jet—shaped into a cylinder by an upstream flow distributor—impinging on the aerodynamic tip and washing over the entire element surface. This process cools the cladding while heating the hydrogen to ~4000-4200 K for subsequent expansion in the engine nozzle, which is the fundamental mechanism enabling NTP's high specific impulse compared to chemical rockets.

**Key Flow Parameters (Per Single Fuel Element):**

| Parameter | Value | Note / Implication |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mass Flow Rate** | ≈ 5 g/s | *For a core of ~10,000 elements, total flow ≈ 50 kg/s.* |
| **Inlet Temperature** | ≈ 20 K | Liquid hydrogen state. |
| **Inlet Pressure** | ≈ 22 atm | |
| **Jet Diameter** | 20 mm | Matches the element's outer diameter for full coverage. |
| **Jet Cross-Sectional Area** | ≈ 3.14 cm² | |
| **Jet Velocity** | ≈ 22.4 cm/s | **Ensures a laminar flow regime**, crucial for stable and efficient heat transfer without destructive turbulence. |
